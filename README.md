I’m _Chathura Nirmal Weerasinghe_.An Electronic Engineering Undergraduate, specializing in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. I am passionate about **Human-Computer Interaction, Wearable Devices,** and **Embadded Machine Learning.**

One of my notable projects received a grant from the World Bank. Using ultrasound technology, our team developed a patient height-measuring device for Sri Lankan clinical systems. We successfully addressed the challenge of low reflections due to dense scalp hair by employing a K-means clustering algorithm. This project, known as 
[MeasureUP](https://measureup.lk/)
, was commercially launched as a startup and received support from the World Bank-funded AHEAD program. Under the guidance of Dr. Ajith Pasqual, I gained comprehensive experience in medical product development, from prototyping to navigating regulatory requirements and intellectual property considerations.

In my academic background, I received 
[bronze medals for both the Physics and Mathematics Olympiad and secured the 9th place representing Sri Lanka at the 12th Statistics Olympiad in 2020](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chathura-weerasinghe-9a08bb213/details/honors/).
In addition, I achieved 99th place out of 200000+ candidates in my country, with straight A’s in Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and English.

In my free time, I am interested in video and graphic designing, as well as scriptwriting and acting in dramas.
