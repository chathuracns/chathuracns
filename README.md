#### _Passionate in Assertive Augmentation | Human Computer Interaction | Embedded Machine Learning_
I’m  [_Chathura Nirmal Weerasinghe_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chathura-weerasinghe-9a08bb213/). An Electronic Engineering Undergraduate, specializing in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. I am passionate about **Human-Computer Interaction, Assertive Augmentation ,** and **Embadded Machine Learning.**

One of my notable projects received a grant from the World Bank. Using ultrasound technology, our team developed a patient height-measuring device for Sri Lankan clinical systems. We successfully addressed the challenge of low reflections due to dense scalp hair by employing a K-means clustering algorithm. This project, known as 
[_MeasureUP_](https://measureup.lk/)
, was commercially launched as a startup and received support from the World Bank-funded AHEAD program. Under the guidance of Dr. Ajith Pasqual, I gained comprehensive experience in medical product development, from prototyping to navigating regulatory requirements and intellectual property considerations.

In my academic background, I received 
[_bronze medals for both the Physics and Mathematics Olympiad and secured the 9th place representing Sri Lanka at the 12th Statistics Olympiad in 2020_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chathura-weerasinghe-9a08bb213/details/honors/).
For GCE Advanced level exam, I achieved 99th place out of 200000+ candidates in Sri Lanka, with  A’s in all four subjects Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and English.

In my free time, I am interested in video and graphic designing, as well as scriptwriting and acting in dramas Here, I have attached some of my dramas. Go and see "What the Sense of Humor through an Engineering Eye is." [_1."Latha.AI"_](https://youtu.be/yPXYBtht1XQ?feature=shared) ,  [_2."Parakiyana Tharuka"_](https://youtu.be/5t9_GxEX5Pk?feature=shared).
